/* THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL (DOM) */

  // - The Document Object Model is a structured tree/chart of elements created by the browser representing the elements displayed on the page.
    // - The top of the tree is the entire document.
    // - This is followed by the html element (root element) as this is the first element on the page.
    // - The html element of the tree has two child components (siblings) which are the head tag and body tag.
    // - Subsequently, any tags created within either of those elements in the HTML document will stem from its respective node and so on and so on.
  // - JavaScript can be used to manipulate each element.
  // - Each element/node is Object Oriented meaning it has it's own set of properties and methods for each.
    // - Properties and Methods can therefore be added as well.
  // - The document object is a property of the window object.

  /* THE DOCUMENT OBJECT */
  console.log("! - Document Object Model - !");

    // - The document keyword represents the HTML loaded into the web browser.
    // - There are numerous methods that can be used in marriage with the document keyword.
